            <h2 class="title-bar" id="tip-title">Overfishing is considered the largest threat to the sustainability of our seafood resources.</h2>
            <p>Overfishing occurs when we take too many fish from an area, and the remaining fish are unable to reproduce and replenish their populations to a healthy level. <br> The devastating collapse of the once iconic Northern Atlantic cod fishery in
                the early 1990s remains one of the most globally recognized cases of overfishing. <br> Today, cod populations remain at low levels, with only a few populations showing signs of slow recovery.</p>
            <h2 class="title-bar" id="tip-title">The Challenges</h2>
            <p>Modern Advances Equate to Bigger Catches<br> With more accurate technology and efficient fishing gear — and larger vessels able to stay out fishing for longer periods of time — we are catching more fish, much quicker than we have in the past.

                <br>Some Fish are More Vulnerable to Overfishing than Others<br> Typically, fish species that are large and have long life spans are more vulnerable to overfishing than smaller fish with shorter life spans. Age of reproduction also plays
                a role.</p>

            <h2>A Lack of Fish Population Data can Lead to Overfishing</h2>
            <p>Understanding stock status requires regular scientific monitoring of the fish populations being harvested. Not having accurate information about a fish population’s distribution and abundance can result in catch limits that are too high. Illegal
                Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing can also lead to inaccurate information about a species’ abundance, since these catches are not reported, and it is unknown how many are removed from the fish population at any given time.</p>

            <h2 class="title-bar" id="tip-title">Green Turtles</h2>
            <p>The green turtle is one of the largest sea turtles and the only herbivore among the different species. Green turtles are in fact named for the greenish color of their cartilage and fat, not their shells. In the Eastern Pacific, a group of
                green turtles that have darker shells are called black turtles by the local community. Green turtles are found mainly in tropical and subtropical waters. Like other sea turtles, they migrate long distances between feeding grounds and the
                beaches from where they hatched. Classified as endangered, green turtles are threatened by overharvesting of their eggs, hunting of adults, being caught in fishing gear and loss of nesting beach sites.</p>
